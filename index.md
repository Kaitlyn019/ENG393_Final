### Welcome! We are currently doing a project on the affects of the COVID-19 quarantine has on the UMD student population socially and ways students have adapted. We will be keeping this page updated with various sites and events for the UMD student community, so keep an eye out for that! 

### As we prepare, our first step is collecting survey data. If you have a few minutes to spare to fill it out, we would really appreciate it. Thank you!
